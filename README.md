# vispy_fuck
to figure out vispy once and for all

The goal here is to at least somewhat master vispy.scene operations.
The primary test is to successfully render a scene containing:
 - a sphere with a 2D texture applied correctly
 - an xyz-axis and a plane for reference
 - ability to modify and move the sphere using transforms
 - add additional spheres as children to other spheres
 - use a timer and transforms to move spheres along a closes path
 - render a polygon to draw the path traversed
